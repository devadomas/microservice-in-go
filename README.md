# Microservice in Golang

## What is this?

A personal educational (sorta) project dedicated to expressing my beliefs on building production-worthy microservices in Golang.

This repository could be a place to lean about patterns, as a boilerplate for microservice development, or neither.
My goal of this project is to share my thoughts and opinions about Golang and it's ecosystem. 

Every problem, every developer, every team, every company ... have different ideas on how certain things should be done.
It doesn't mean it fits you. It's not the only way to implement things. And certainly it's not the only way I would code.

## Objectives

These are some of my opinions, on what should the microservice have. 
I will try to share my toughs on every objective in separate files located in **/somefolder**.

# History

I started this project due my interest in Golang and passion for lean approach to ... basically life in general. Golang was on my radar for past 6 years. Due to my focus on tech management and primary expertise being in NodeJS, PHP and platform engineering, I never had a chance to try it out myself. I treat this project as a canvas for exploring the Golang and expression of my beliefs on what the "production-worthy" service should have.
