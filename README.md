# Microservice in Golang

Personal project to assemble microservice boilerplate in Golang based on my beliefs in code structure, architectural patterns, features that microservice should have, etc.

## Objectives
- [ ] Set the desired code structure
- [ ] Define logging
- [ ] Define monitoring (HTTP stats, APM)

### Note
> Everything is based on my beliefs and should be taken with good grain of salt. Every individual or team has their own "perfect" recipe of what works, and what doesn't. Project is dedicated to learn and share knowledge.

# Beliefs
- Little 3rd party dependencies(close to std)
- Clean code structure(Clean code, Domain Driven Design)

# Sources
